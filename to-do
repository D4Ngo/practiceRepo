Write a program to convert a matrix into sparse matrix for 3 tuple

example

give a matrix

    0 0 0 0 9 0
    0 8 0 0 0 0
A = 4 0 0 2 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 5
    0 0 2 0 0 0
  
The program should print a output of 3 column and n+1 rows where n is the number of positive integer in the given array

example for the give array A the output will be

row   column    values
5       6         6
0       4         9
1       1         8
2       0         4
2       3         2
3       5         5
4       2         2

where first row has the value of number of rows and coloumns and number of positive number in the array respectively
2nd row 1st column has the value of the row of the 1st +ve integer in the array
2nd row 2nd column has the column of the 1st +ve number
2nd row 3rd has the value of the first positive number

example if we read the array row wise than the first positive number will be 9 and it row and column will be 0 and 4 so the 2nd row has the value 0   4     9
continue printing this until you reach the last positive number in the array
