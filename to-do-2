Friends Part 2 and final Problem for our practiceRepo

Write a program to apply brute force string matching or naive algorithm

So consider m is the length of a pattern and n is the length of the searchable string or text. The algorithm
can be interpreted as a sliding a pattern P over the text strng S and observe for which shift all the characters
in the pattern match the corresponding character in the string. The pattern is shifting successively
from I = 0 to n-m, and for wach shifting compare the pattern P[1 to m] with the string S[I+1 to I+m]

Example
Suppose the given string is S="abbcdabcd" and pattern string P = "bcda"

So your program should be able to tell if the pattern P is available in string S or not.In our case we can say
that pattern P is present in text S starting from index 2 of string S.
